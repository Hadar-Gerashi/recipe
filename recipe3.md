Here’s a simple recipe for a Vanilla Sponge Cake in English:

Ingredients:
1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour
4 large eggs (at room temperature)
1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
Pinch of salt
Powdered sugar for dusting (optional)
Instructions:
Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch (20cm) round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.

Beat the eggs: In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the sugar using an electric mixer on high speed for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes thick, pale, and doubles in volume.

Add the dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture using a spatula. Be gentle to avoid deflating the batter.

Add the butter and vanilla: Slowly fold in the melted butter and vanilla extract. Mix until just combined.

Bake the cake: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The cake should be golden brown and spring back when lightly pressed.

Cool: Let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

Serve: Once the cake has cooled, you can dust it with powdered sugar if desired or serve it as is. Enjoy it plain or with whipped cream and fresh fruit for extra flavor!

This cake is light, airy, and perfect for any occasion. You can also decorate it with icing, frosting, or fruits of your choice!
